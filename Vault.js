//First, I will make addition as one of my pseudocode methods and apply output to new variable.

const num1= 3 
const num2= 7
const vaultNum1=(num1 + num2)

//I will than choose another two ways of summing up the numbers to equal the code.

const num1x= 8
const num2x= 5
const vaultNum2 =(num1x*num2x)

const num1Sub= 80
const num2Sub= 41
const vaultNum3=(num1Sub-num2Sub)

//Lastly, I will put each variable into order in a console.log and make it into an alert to alert on screen.

const text=("You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:")

alert (text + " " + vaultNum1 + "-" + vaultNum2 + "-" + vaultNum3)

//alert("You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:")

//The combination of the lock is 10 - 40 - 39.
